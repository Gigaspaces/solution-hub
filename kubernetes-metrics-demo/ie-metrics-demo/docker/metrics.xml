        A metric (or a group of metrics) can be assigned to a different sampler. For example, suppose:
        1. we want most os metrics to use the `low` sampler, but...
        2. we want os_memory metrics to use the `high` sampler, and...
        3. we don't want os_cpu metrics at all

        <metric prefix="os"        sampler="low"/>
        <metric prefix="os_memory" sampler="high"/>
        <metric prefix="os_cpu"    sampler="off"/>
